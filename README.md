# Flutter code base

My flutter code base

## Technical

- [Dependencies injection](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable)
- [State management Bloc/Cubit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
- [Flavor development/product](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b)
- [Internationalizing i18n](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)

## Architect

## Note 
There are 2 different type of bloc we can use. I want to choose to use the different bloc for different purpose:

- for global bloc: use Bloc
- for local bloc: use Cubit

Why? Because global state change can be from anywhere in the app, any screen, so it makes sense to trigger an event from 1 screen, and state is updated in all related screens in the app.
However, as for local bloc, the event and state are in the same screen, so it really doesnâ€™t matter if the trigger is an event or a function call. Therefore, to simplify the code, I think cubit is better choice.


##terminal
- flutter build android flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
- flutter gen-l10n
- flutter packages pub run build_runner build
